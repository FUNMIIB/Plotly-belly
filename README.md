# Plotly-belly

**Overview of Project**

From the module, we  created the dashboard partially and we need to complete it in the challenge. We have a completed panel for demographic information and now we have to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, we want the volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. So that if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

**Deliverables**

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
Deliverable 5: A written report on the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard analysis README.md.

**Resources**

Data Source: BellyButton_bar_chart_starter_code.js, BellyButton_bubble_chart_starter_code.js, BellyButton_bubble_chart_starter_code.js and index.html
Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, JSON and IO (Web Server)
Software: ES6+ and Visual Studio Code

**Results**
For the first deliverable, 
- When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data will be displayed in the dashboard, and the bar chart has the following:
- The top 10 sample_values are sorted in descending order
- The top 10 sample_values as values
- The otu_ids as the labels

For the deliverable 2, 
- When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data will be displayed in the dashboard. All three charts will also be working according to their requirements when a sample is selected from the dropdown menu.

For deliverable 3, 
- When the webpage loads, the bar and bubble chart are working according to the requirements in Deliverable 1 and 2, respectively, and the gauge chart is working according to the requirements listed for this Deliverable.
