# Plotly-belly

**Overview of Project**

From the module, we  created the dashboard partially and we need to complete it in the challenge. We have a completed panel for demographic information and now we have to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, we want the volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. So that if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

**Deliverables**

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
Deliverable 5: A written report on the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard analysis README.md.
